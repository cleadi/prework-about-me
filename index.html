      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Dillon! I'm happy to be here, finally getting started with web and software development after a few years working in marketing and IT support.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Buxton, Derbyshire, UK. I'm a weird British-American hybrid.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video games, books, movies, fantasy anything, sci-fi most things, walks, hikes, tennis, runs, the gym, coffee, ice cream.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Front-end developer or software engineer or web designer... I'm not 100% sure. Maybe a little of each?</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Minneapolis, MN.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've long been interested in technology, writing, communication, design, psychology, and how people interact with software and user interfaces -- so this seems like a good combination of many interests and proclivities. I'm also trying to guide myself to a place where my work-life can be sane, happy, and most useful to others; I like the idea of working for small or local businesses. Last but not least, I'm looking for a stable career path.</p>
